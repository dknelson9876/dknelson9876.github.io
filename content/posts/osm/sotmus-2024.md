In June 2024, the OpenStreetMap US organization held State of the Map US in Salt Lake City, Utah. I got to attend a bunch of sessions to hear about all kinds of projects people have been working on related to the map. Here's some of the details and links for things that I heard about:
- **OSMUS Trails Stewardship Initiative**
    - TODO wiki link with trail tagging guidelines
    - TODO tasking manager link

    - TODO github link
    - TODO check coverage in utah
    - TODO investigate if GNIS provides more details about utah (suburbs? developments?) like Xanadu
- **gradient.osmcha.org**:
    - TODO github link
    - TODO investigate what is possible with the osmcha API

    - TODO wiki links
    - TODO investigate drone prices and flight licenses
