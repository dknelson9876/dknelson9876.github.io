Summary: A list of the projects I've dipped my toes into in OpenStreetMap

- Removing `name_1` from Salt Lake County
    - Including standardizing names according to wiki/Utah/NamingConventions
    - [ ] Upon completing Salt Lake County will probably be a good time to actually bring up naming conventions on the forums, since Nominatim has no interest in improving `name:prefix` or any other support until we do so
- Removing `name_1` from country roads
- Updating UTA routes
    - Ongoing efforts to keep routes up to date
    - [ ] Conflate platform/stop names
    - Versioned download of stop geojson is held on to so that I can just diff against it in the future
- Salt Lake address import
    - Probably will be a lot easier with the conflation JOSM plugin, now that I know how to use it
- New Zealand LINZ Building Import
    - Performed in JOSM using the MapWithAI plugin
