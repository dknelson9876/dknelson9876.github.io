Summary: Welcome to my adventure into Pelican as a personal wiki

Welcome to dknelson.dev, a website that I'm going to be using to host all the miscellaneous notes that I take about what I'm working on currently. This probably won't be very useful to many people, but on the off chance that the things I cobble together from the various guides of the internet and my own hours of frustration could reduce the frustration of others.

This site is being built using [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html), which allows me to continue taking notes in Markdown. I have hopes to add, at minimum, a dark theme and a search box, but I never know how much time I'm going to have, or what I'll dedicate it to (considering it already took me a month after the idea to get around to putting this up). So, don't rely on anything here.

On the off chance a stranger on the internet wandered their way here, thanks!
